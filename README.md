## Abstract

The motivation behind undertaking this project on object extraction in satellite images stems
from the increasing availability of high-resolution satellite imagery and the growing need for
automated analysis of these vast datasets. Satellite imagery provides a wealth of valuable
information for various applications, including urban planning, environmental monitoring,
disaster management, and agricultural assessment. However, manually extracting objects of
interest from these images is a time-consuming and labour- intensive task. This project aims
to classify the contents of a satellite image with the help of topics covered during the lectures
and deep learning models. We aim to develop a robust solution for automating classification
of objects in satellite images. Below shows a graph that tells how the number of satellites are
increasing every year. With the help of this graph we can tell that automating the process of
identifying features from a large lot of pictures taken by the satellites is really helpful.
